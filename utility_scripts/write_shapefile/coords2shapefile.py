"""

Converts list of coordinates (in degrees) to a shapefile that can be uploaded to CaSPAr.

Polygon does not need to be closed.

Requires shapefile package which can be installed using "pip install pyshp".
For further details see: https://code.google.com/archive/p/pyshp/

def coords2shapefile(filename,coords):

    """
    Converts given coordinates into shapefile that can be uploaded to CaSPAr.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename: str
        Name of the shapefile (without any extension). Files that will be produced are:
        <filename>.dbf
        <filename>.prj
        <filename>.shp
        <filename>.shx
        Zip these four files to upload to CaSPAr.

    coords: array
        2-D Array of coordinates of a single polygon. CaSPAr does not support
        multiple polygons. Polygon does not need to be closed. The shapefile package is
        checking and copies automatically the first point to the end if polygon is not closed.
        Example:
        [[-123,50], [-118,40], [-118,44], [-113,44]]              # unclosed geometry
        [[-123,50], [-118,40], [-118,44], [-113,44],[-123,50]]    # closed geometry

    Returns
    -------
    None
